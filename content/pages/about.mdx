Welcome to my platform!

[KrlK.tech](https://krlk.tech/) serves as a space for me to showcase my work and exchange insights with fellow enthusiasts.
I share here my projects mainly related to electronics and programming.
I strive to provide detailed explanations, code snippets, YouTube videos, and so on, to share my knowledge with others.

Beyond the realm of ü§ñ and üßë‚Äçüíª, you may come across posts that delve into my DIY and artful ideas.
I indulge in unconventional projects that showcase my inventiveness and ‚ú® _artistic side_ ‚ú®.
From DIY creations to artistic endeavors, these ventures serve as outlets for my creativity and further fuel my passion for innovation.

At this point, I want to emphasize that this site can evolve and adapt in various unexpected directions.
The information provided on this page is not set in stone.
Be aware that this page is my first blog post.

## Purpose

In the year 2023, as I write these words, amidst the rise of addictive short-form video content that has gained immense popularity, running a personal blog may have a highly lower likelihood of achieving a wide reach compared to currently popular social media platforms like TikTok.
Nevertheless, I choose to maintain this website with the awareness that it may not garner the same level of exposure.

One of the reasons for my commitment is to improve my English language skills and writing abilities, as English is not my native tongue.
Connecting with a global community of similar enthusiasts is also a benefit.
I aim to enhance my proficiency in the language while also focusing on delivering valuable content.
